# Approach:
# 1. Use a dictionary to group elements by their sum of indices (i + j), which represents the diagonal.
# 2. Traverse the matrix and populate the dictionary with elements for each diagonal.
# 3. Collect the diagonals from the dictionary, reversing the order of every other diagonal for the required order.

class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return []
        
        diagonals = {}
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                if i + j not in diagonals:
                    diagonals[i + j] = []
                diagonals[i + j].append(matrix[i][j])
        
        result = []
        for key in sorted(diagonals.keys()):
            if key % 2 == 0:
                result.extend(reversed(diagonals[key]))
            else:
                result.extend(diagonals[key])
        
        return result
