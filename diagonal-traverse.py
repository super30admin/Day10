# The solution traverses the matrix diagonally by iterating through all diagonals, collecting elements in an intermediate list, 
# and appending them to the result. For even diagonals, the elements are reversed before adding them to maintain the desired order.      
# Time Complexity: O(Nâ‹…M)
# Space Complexity: O(min(N,M))
