# The algorithm iterates through the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting boundaries (left, right, up, down) after each traversal
#  to avoid revisiting elements. It moves right, down, left, and up while ensuring rows and columns are not re-traversed.
# Time complexity: O(Mâ‹…N). This is because we visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1). This is because we don't use other data structures. 
# Remember that we don't include the output array in the space complexity.
